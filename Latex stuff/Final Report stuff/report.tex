	\chapter{Conclusion}
	So far in this report, we have explored Shape from Shading problems which focus on \emph{lambertian} surfaces, an assumption does not hold for real life objects except for a very few cases. Thus, these models cannot be used for real life applications extensively. But nonetheless SFS has innumerous applications viz. \emph{medical imaging, face reconstruction, terrain mapping, page reconstruction} and so on.\\
	
	\noindent 
	SFS is a simple yet a powerful tool for object reconstruction as it requires minimal input to reconstruct the original scene although the problem becomes difficult for complex cases. \\
	
	\noindent
	This work can be extended to accomodate the non-lambertian parameters to the Hamilton Jacobi equation in order to get closer to reality. On the other hand analysis namely, existence and uniqueness becomes difficult to study. Also regarding the numerics, one can attempt to develop higher order schemes to improve the accuracy of the solution.\\
	
	\noindent 
	Therefore, there is still room for improvements. It would be very nice if this work has
	inspired its readers to contribute to the related fields. \\
